# Idea Logger Expo App

This folder contains a simple React Native implementation of the Idea Logger concept built with Expo. It mirrors the functionality of the web version but is designed to run on mobile devices using the Expo Go app.

## Features
- Add ideas with title, description and tags
- Ideas are stored locally using `AsyncStorage`
- Filter ideas by tag
- Delete ideas from the list

## Running
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the development server with `npm start` (or `expo start`)
3. Use the Expo Go app on your device or an emulator to view the app

This minimal setup lets you test the Idea Logger on mobile via Expo.
