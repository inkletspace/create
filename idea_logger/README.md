# Idea Logger Web App

This is a simple web-based implementation of the Idea Logger concept.
It lets you capture ideas with a title, description, and tags. Ideas are
stored in your browser's `localStorage` so they persist between visits.

## Features

- Add ideas with title, content, and tags.
- View a list of saved ideas.
- Filter ideas by tag.
- Delete ideas you no longer need.

To run the app, open `index.html` in a web browser.
